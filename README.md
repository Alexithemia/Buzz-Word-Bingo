# Buzz Word Bingo
**A Buzz Word Tracker**

You're being asked to write a buzzword tracker that can keep track of buzzwords, the amount of points for a buzzword being spoken aloud, and the total amount of points overall. This system should keep track of **at most 5 buzzwords**. The intention is to load the system with at most 5 buzzwords and if any of those 5 buzzwords are spoken during a conversation, the matching amount of points is added to a "total point count" managed by the system.

# Welcome to Team Buzzâ„¢
Our system has been getting a lot of traction and we need to rebuild the API server with NodeJS
to handle all the connections, we need you to create the server using **ExpressJS**. Our CTO will provide you with the specs below.

**At this time:**
- you will not build the front-end.
- you will not implement a database.

## The Specs
We like RESTful architechure. We like CRUD. As always, data will be sent to the server as `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

### Creating Buzzwords
This is how your buzzword objects should look like after receiving a `POST` to the uri `/buzzword`

```javascript
{
  buzzWord: String,
  points: Number
  heard: false
}
```

You will store these objects in memory for the time being. Meaning that if the **server** crashes and after restarting and listening again, your app will have no buzzword objects, no collection containing buzzword objects, no scores, nada.

**Routes overview table:**

| **METHOD** **ROUTE (uri)** | **BODY** | **RESPONSE** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /` | empty | render HTML `index.html` | serves the `index.html` |
| `GET /buzzwords` | empty | `{ "buzzWords": [...] }` A JSON response containing an array of current buzz words | Retrieves all buzzwords |
| `POST /buzzword` | `{ "buzzWord": String, "points": Number }` | `{ "success": true }` | Creates a new buzzword object. Returns `true` if successful else `false`|
| `PUT /buzzword` | `{ "buzzWord": String, "heard": Bool }` |  `{ "success": true, newScore: Number }` | Updates a buzzword's heard value. This also marks that a buzzword has been heard and should update the total score. Returns `true` and the new total score if successful otherwise returns just `false` |
| `DELETE /buzzword` | `{ "buzzWord": String }` | `{ "success": true }` | Delete a buzzword. Returns `true` if successful else `false` |
| `POST /reset` | `{ "reset": true }` | `{ "success": true }` | Resets the server. All buzzwords are removed and total scores reset to `0` |

## Routes detailed
`GET /`: Serves the static file `index.html` which should be located in your `public/` directory. For now just have a stub HTML file.

`GET /buzzwords`: Returns a JSON response containing single key, `buzzWords` which will be an array containing objects (see [Buzz Word Object Section](https://gist.github.com/sgnl/378bd9b54c566f0f22ef#buzz-word-object) for details)

`POST /buzzword`: Creates a new buzz word object. The body **should** have these keys:
  - `buzzWord` which contains the buzz word as a `String` and
  - `points` property is how many points that word is worth when scored, this value is of data-type `Number`.
  Example:
  if `{ "buzzword": "Agile is amazing", "score": 1000 }` is sent to this route then the server will create a new [buzz word object](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#bodyparserurlencodedoptions) and add it to a collection.

`PUT /buzzword`:  Updates a buzz word's `heard` property. This also marks that the buzzword has been "heard" in the conversation. Therefore, the total score should be incremented with the score value attached to the heard buzzword. The body **should** contain these keys:
  - `buzzWord` which is the buzz word to modify.
  - `heard` Changes the value stored.
  Example:
  if `{ "buzzWord": "Social-Mobile", "heard": true }` is sent to this route then the server will find the buzz word "Social-Mobile" and change it's `heard` property to `true`. It should then update the total score kept on the server and return that value as part of the response object.

`DELETE /buzzword`: Deletes a buzz word from the collection.

## Score?
For now, it's up to you on how you keep track of the user's score.

## Middleware to use
[Body-Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) - Use this module to help parse the `data` coming from a request. Focus on the **[urlencodedoptions](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#bodyparserurlencodedoptions)** section of the README, use the `extended: true` option. Take some time to scan through the documentation. What is `body-parser` module doing for us? Is this module doing something we previously had to do manually?

## Getting Started
1. Fork and clone this repo.
1. You'll be using `git` and `npm` so be sure to **initialize** those tools before you use them.
1. Install the packages you need
1. Use **Postman** to test your routes.
1. Remember to commit often!
